# 📁 Where to Find Your Deployment Files

## ✅ **The files DO exist!** Here's exactly where to find them:

### **Server File Location:**
```
dist/server/node-build.mjs  ← This is your main server file
```

### **Frontend Files Location:**
```
dist/spa/index.html
dist/spa/assets/index-BCx_Azzn.js
dist/spa/assets/index-CvJ_BQIB.css
dist/spa/favicon.ico
dist/spa/placeholder.svg
dist/spa/robots.txt
```

## 🎯 **Easy Method: Download Everything**

### Option 1: Download Complete Project
1. Click [**Download Project**](#project-download) button above
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Look inside: `your-project/dist/` folder
4. You'll find both `server/` and `spa/` folders

### Option 2: Just Get the Built Files
If you only need the production files, here's what to copy:

**For Full Stack Deployment:**
- Copy the entire `dist/` folder to your server
- Upload `package.json` 
- Upload `package-production.json`

**File Structure You Should Have:**
```
your-deployment/
├── dist/
│   ├── server/
│   │   └── node-build.mjs     ← Main server file
│   └── spa/
│       ├── index.html         ← Frontend entry
│       └── assets/            ← CSS & JS files
├── package.json               ← Dependencies
└── package-production.json    ← Production config
```

## 🚀 **Alternative: Simplified Plesk Deployment**

If you're having trouble locating files, try this simpler approach:

### **Method A: Static Deployment (No Node.js needed)**
1. **Upload only these files to your domain's `httpdocs` folder:**
   - `dist/spa/index.html`
   - `dist/spa/assets/` (entire folder)
   - `dist/spa/favicon.ico`
   - `dist/spa/robots.txt`
   - `dist/spa/placeholder.svg`

2. **Create `.htaccess` file in `httpdocs`:**
   ```apache
   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
   RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
   ```

3. **Done!** Your website will work without Node.js

**⚠️ Note:** Static deployment won't have bot detection, but login/lifestyle pages will work.

### **Method B: Node.js Deployment with Verification**

1. **Upload to Plesk in this exact structure:**
   ```
   httpdocs/app/
   ├── server/
   │   └── node-build.mjs
   ├── spa/
   │   ├── index.html
   │   └── assets/
   └── package.json
   ```

2. **Verify files exist in Plesk File Manager:**
   - Navigate to `/httpdocs/app/server/`
   - You should see `node-build.mjs` file
   - File size should be ~1.5KB

3. **Configure Node.js in Plesk:**
   - Application root: `/httpdocs/app`
   - Startup file: `server/node-build.mjs` (not `dist/server/node-build.mjs`)

---

## 🔍 **If You Still Can't Find the File:**

### **Check Build Status:**
The file is generated when you run `npm run build`. If missing:

1. **Re-download the project** using [Download Project](#project-download)
2. **Or rebuild locally:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
3. **Check the `dist/` folder** - it should contain both `server/` and `spa/`

### **Verify File Contents:**
The `node-build.mjs` file should contain:
- Express server setup
- Static file serving
- API routes
- Frontend routing

### **File Size Reference:**
- `node-build.mjs`: ~1.5KB
- `index.html`: ~400 bytes  
- `index-BCx_Azzn.js`: ~570KB
- `index-CvJ_BQIB.css`: ~67KB

---

## ✅ **Quick Test:**

After downloading the project:
1. **Check if file exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la dist/server/node-build.mjs
   ```
2. **Should show:** `-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1563 [date] node-build.mjs`

The files are definitely there! Try downloading the complete project again if you're not seeing them. 🎯
